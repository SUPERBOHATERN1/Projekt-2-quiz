# STAR WARS QUIZ #CODERSCAMP2020

The aim of the project was to create a Star Wars Quiz based on the recommendations from the #CodersCamp2020 JavaScript Project (https://github.com/CodersCamp2020/CodersCamp2020.Project.JavaScript.StarWarsQuiz). The project was an opportunity to memorize and practise JavaScript skills learned during programming course organized by CodersCrew.

During the game you have exactly 1 minute to answer as many questions as possible. Your task is to select what character /vehicle or starship from Star Wars is showed in the picture. The computer will be your rival.
